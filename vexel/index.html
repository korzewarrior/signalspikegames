            </div>

            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Vexel is a clean, turn-based territory game where every move is about shape, space, and timing. You
                    place polyomino pieces onto the board to claim territory and block opponents before they box you
                    out.</p>

                <p>The core rule set is intentionally strict. Your first piece must touch your corner. After that, your
                    color can only connect at corners, never edge-to-edge. That single constraint creates most of the
                    strategy.</p>

                <p>Each color has the same piece bank, so advantage comes from placement order, rotations, and mirror
                    choices. You can rotate and flip pieces every turn, undo when needed, and pass when no legal move
                    remains.</p>

                <p>You can play with 1 to 4 human colors and fill the rest with bots. The game ends when everyone passes
                    in sequence, then scoring is based on covered tiles. It runs directly in the browser with no
                    install.</p>

                <p>Vexel is built as a self-contained web game and now lives directly on this site. Open the play page
                    and start immediately.</p>

                <h2>How It Started</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="about-text">
                <p>My brother-in-law introduced me to this style of game while he was visiting, and we played it
                    together with our kids.</p>

                <p>What stuck with me was how well it worked across ages. The kids could jump in quickly, and the adults
                    still had plenty to think about every turn.</p>

                <p>After that visit, I wanted a version we could get to anytime without setup. No unpacking a box, no
                    clearing a table, no extra friction.</p>

                <p>That is why I built Vexel as a browser game. Open it, start a game, play a few turns, close it, come
                    back later.</p>

                <p>I also wanted it to work whether people are available or not, so you can play solo when schedules do
                    not line up, or play together when they do.</p>

                <p>This project came from a real family moment, and the goal has stayed simple: keep that experience
                    accessible, repeatable, and easy to share.</p>

            <div class="about-text">
                <p>The visual design of Vexel was heavily inspired by Dan Hollick's <a
                        href="https://www.makingsoftware.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Making Software</a> book
                    and site. His work has been a huge creative influence on this project.</p>

                <p>I deeply admire the way he combines clarity, personality, and craft: strong typography, intentional
                    color choices, tactile interface surfaces, and visual systems that feel both playful and precise.
                </p>

                <p>Several presentation choices on this page and in the game's UI were shaped by that influence, and
                    this credit is given with genuine respect, gratitude, and love for his incredible design aesthetic
                    and teaching.</p>
