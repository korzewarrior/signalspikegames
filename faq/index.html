                    <h2>Who is Signal Spike Games?</h2>
                    <p>Primarily a solo game studio that scales up when needed. We're building an asynchronous gamedev
                        studio with a small, dedicated team working together on projects in a shared team environment.
                        No unnecessary hierarchy, just autonomy and focused creative work.</p>

                    <h2>What engine do you use?</h2>
                    <p>Depends on the project. Starboys is built in Unity 6. Bloodrust uses Spectre Engine, a custom engine built in C. Null Online was built from scratch with a custom lightweight stack. We pick whatever fits.</p>

                    <h2>Can I stream or make videos about your games?</h2>
                    <p>Yes. You have full permission to stream, record, upload, and monetize content featuring any of
                        our games. No need to ask. We'd love to see it.</p>

                    <h2>How do I report a bug?</h2>
                    <p>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/GJuGbG2RzB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a> and
                        post in the relevant channel, or email <a
                            href="mailto:hello@signalspike.games">hello@signalspike.games</a>. Include what happened,
                        what you expected, and any screenshots if you can.</p>

                    <h2>Are you hiring?</h2>
                    <p>We work with collaborators on a project-by-project basis. If you do game art, music, sound
                        design, or level design and want to work together on something, reach out at <a
                            href="mailto:hello@signalspike.games">hello@signalspike.games</a> with your portfolio.</p>

                    <h2>Will your games come to consoles?</h2>
                    <p>PC first, always. Console ports are something we'd like to do eventually but aren't promising
                        yet. If it happens, we'll announce it.</p>

                    <h2>Are your games free?</h2>
                    <p>Depends on the game. Null Online is free. Starboys and Bloodrust will be paid games. We price
                        things fairly and don't do microtransactions beyond the occasional joke cosmetic (see: Null
                        Online's $3 gold pixel).</p>

                    <h2>How often do you release games?</h2>
                    <p>When they're done. We don't crunch and we don't rush. The roadmap on the homepage shows what's in
                        progress and what's coming. Some of these are small experiments that take a day (like Null
                        Online), others are bigger projects that take months or years.</p>

                    <h2>Can I use your game assets, logos, or screenshots?</h2>
                    <p>For press, content creation, fan art, or personal use: yes, go for it. For commercial use beyond
                        that, email us first.</p>

                    <h2>How do I get in touch?</h2>
                    <p>Email <a href="mailto:hello@signalspike.games">hello@signalspike.games</a> or join the <a
                            href="https://discord.gg/GJuGbG2RzB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a>. We read
