                    <h1>Signal Spike Games</h1>
                    <p>It's just me (for now). I'm a solo dev building a studio from the ground up. I
                        started messing with Flash games around 2004 in middle school, moved to web games in 2006, Unity
                        around 2009, and Unreal Engine in 2014.</p>

                    <p>I've participated in over two dozen game jams and have prototyped countless more gameplay systems
                        simply for the fun of it. That rapid prototyping is where I usually live.</p>

                    <p>Recently, I culled my "in progress" folder of games I've started working on down from around 120
                        to around 10–20 that I really want to finish. I've front-loaded my pipeline and built a
                        realistic schedule to finally get them out the door.</p>

                    <p>Right now I'm shipping <a href="/starboys/">Starboys</a>, a gravity-flipping shooter, and <a
                            href="/bloodrust/">Bloodrust</a>, a dark fantasy action RPG. The <a href="/">homepage</a>
                        has the full roadmap.</p>

                    <p>I do the design, code, and creative direction myself. When a project needs something I can't
                        do (art, music, maps), I bring in the right collaborators.</p>

                    <p>If you want to talk, I'm around:</p>
                    <ul class="about-links">

                    <h2>The Goal</h2>
                    <p>I want to build an asynchronous gamedev studio with a small, dedicated team working together on
                        projects in a shared environment with no unnecessary hierarchy. I believe in autonomy,
                        trust, and the power of focused creative work.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-section about-section--last">
                    <h2>Prior Teams</h2>
                    <p>Before this, there were several efforts to start a team or studio with other people. While those
                        projects ultimately didn't work out as intended, I absolutely loved working with everyone
                        involved. I learned a tremendous amount from my collaborators, and I genuinely cherish the
                        creative energy and time we shared. Every failure was a lesson, and every teammate taught me
                        something new.</p>
