                    mistake. Now- you’re drifting away, rapidly, from the International Space Station… and your home

            </div>

            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Solus was created for Ludum Dare 48 in April 2021. The theme was "Deeper and Deeper". In this
                    survival game, you must navigate the perilous vacuum of space using your suit's thrusters to return
                    to the safety of the ISS.</p>

                <p>The controls are purposefully difficult. The challenge lies in manipulating these controls and
                    managing your maneuvering within this complex movement environment-a deliberate contrast to the
                    expected freedom of open space.</p>

                <p>The project was a collaborative effort during the game jam. Work was done in tandem with
                    <a href="https://atmcmusic.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Joshua Damian</strong></a>,
                    who handled voice work, SFX, music, soundscape, and sound design. The
                    result is an atmospheric experience that relies heavily on audio cues and immersion.
                </p>

                <p>Assets Used: ISS & Astronaut models from Sketchfab. Solar System environment from Unity Asset Store.
                    Sun sounds
                    from NASA.</p>

                <p><em>Psst. Keep an eye out. There might be some cheeky easter eggs for future (or past?) projects
                        hidden in the build.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Lt. Col. Eric "Doc" Schultz</strong><br>
                    <em>November 20, 1973 – September 5, 2017</em>
                </p>

                <p>The guiding voice in Solus is named "Doc" in honor of Lt. Col. Eric Schultz, a test pilot and
                    squadron commander I had the privilege of working with.</p>

                <p>On September 5, 2017, Doc was piloting a classified mission over the Nevada Test and Training Range.
                    During a critical flight maneuver, the aircraft settled onto the desert floor and nearly tumbled.
                    Facing insurmountable odds, Doc managed to wrestle the aircraft back into the air just long enough
                    to allow his backseat Weapons Systems Officer to eject and survive.</p>

                <p>Tragically, due to a malfunction with his own ejection seat, Doc was unable to separate from the
                    aircraft. He sacrificed everything to save his crewmate, and for his heroism, he was posthumously
                    awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.</p>

                <p>He was a brilliant pilot, a dedicated father of five, and a good man. He was honorable, respectful,
                    and always an amazing mentor and guide. This small nod is my personal way of keeping his name and
                    his story in our orbit.</p>
