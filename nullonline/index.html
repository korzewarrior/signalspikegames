            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Null Online is our take on what happens when you strip an MMO down to almost nothing. You're a single
                    pixel in an infinite 3D void. You can move, you can see other players nearby, and you can chat.
                    That's the entire game.</p>

                <p>We built it as an experiment: what's the absolute minimum a shared online world can be and still feel
                    real? No quests, no combat, no inventory, no progression, no map, no objectives. Just presence. A
                    dot, a direction, and the knowledge that the other dots out there are real people. That turned out
                    to be enough to make the space feel alive.</p>

                <p>The design is intentionally restrictive. You can move in 3D space, see nearby players on a proximity
                    radar, and talk to whoever's around. You cannot fight, trade, quest, or do anything else. We wanted
                    to see what kind of interactions emerge when you take away every system except being there.</p>

                <p>On the technical side, accounts are persistent, positions save between sessions, and everything syncs
                    in real-time. The whole thing is about 2.7 MB. It runs as a Windows download or directly in the
                    browser. The game is free.</p>

                <p>There is one thing you can buy: a $3 Supporter Pack that turns your pixel and your name gold. That's
                    it. No stat boosts, no extra features, no gameplay advantage. Just a gold pixel. It's our
                    commentary on the state of premium cosmetics in the industry, and also it looks nice.</p>

                <p>We released Null Online on 5 February 2026. It's a finished game. It does exactly what it's supposed
                    to do.</p>

                <p>Yes. Effectively. It is a satire of the modern MMO and crowdfunding landscape, the obsession with
                    "potential" over gameplay, the paid alpha access, the "roadmaps" that stretch into infinity.</p>

                <p>But here is the punchline: it actually works. Despite being a joke, the tech is real. The server
                    architecture is robust, supporting up to 65,536 concurrent connections per instance. The state
                    synchronization is authoritative. It is a fully functional, persistent multiplayer environment. It
                    just happens to be a void.</p>
